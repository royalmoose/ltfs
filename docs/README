Online user's guidance
======================
You can find information about IBM Spectrum Archive Single Drive Edition on IBM Knowledge Center:
  http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/STQNYL

Usage example:
==============

1. Add /usr/local/bin to the command search path.

  The LTFS package is installed under /usr/local.
  Add /usr/local/bin to your command search path by issuing the following command:

  $ export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"

2. Format the tape cartridge in the LTFS format by issuing the following command for your platform:

   Linux
      $ mkltfs -d /dev/IBMtape0

   Mac OS X
      The device name can be confirmed by the system profiler.
      $ mkltfs -d 0

3. Mount the formatted tape cartridge by issuing the following commands for your platform:

   Linux
     $ mkdir /mnt/ltfs
     $ ltfs /mnt/ltfs -o devname=/dev/IBMtape0

   Mac OS X
     $ mkdir /mnt
     $ mkdir /mnt/ltfs
     $ ltfs /mnt/ltfs -o devname=0

4. Unmount the tape cartridge by issuing the following command.
   (This command empties the data buffer of the file system to the tape cartridge and prepares to eject the cartridge.)

  $ umount /mnt/ltfs
    OR
  $ fusermount -u /mnt/ltfs

Note to users:
==============

  General Notice
  --------------
  - Refer to the documents distributed with the tape drive and IBM Spectrum Archive.
  - The IBM LTO and enterprise tape drives provide the hardware for data compression. The amount of
    written data on a tape can vary from the original data size.


Known Issues:
==============

  1. On Mac OS X: IBM Spectrum Archive does not support moving a folder within an LTFS-formatted cartridge.
     Any attempt to move a folder in such a manner will result in an "operation not permitted" error,
     and the operation will be ignored.  The user can still move a file within an LTFS-formatted cartridge,
     and the user can also move a folder from an LTFS-formatted cartridge to a non-LTFS file system or vice versa.
  2. On Mac OS X: Mac OS X's Spotlight will not display the files on an LTFS-formatted cartridge as a result of a search.
